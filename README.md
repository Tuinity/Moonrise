| Lithium     | <details><summary>‚úÖ compatible</summary>Lithium optimises many of the same parts of the game as Moonrise, for example the chunk system. Moonrise will automatically disable conflicting parts of Lithium. This mechanism needs to be manually validated for each Moonrise and Lithium release.</details> |
| Radium      | <details><summary>‚úÖ compatible</summary>Radium is an unofficial port of Lithium to NeoForge. Radium will automatically disable conflicting parts of itself when Moonrise is present. Any compatibility issues should be reported to Radium first.</details>                                              |
| FerriteCore | <details><summary>üìù requires config changes</summary>In `config/ferritecore-mixin.toml`:<br/>Set `replaceNeighborLookup` and `replacePropertyMap` to `false`</details>                                                                                                                                  |
| C2ME        | <details><summary>‚ùå incompatible</summary>C2ME is based around modifications to the chunk system, which Moonrise replaces wholesale. This makes them fundamentally incompatible.</details>                                                                                                               |
